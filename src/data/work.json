To accomplish these, greater care was given to the use of simplified code and grids. Each visual element was optimized and designed for mobile. The influence of Shopify, Squarespace and Lodgify, among others, resulted in the incorporation of minimalism, flat design, duotones, neutral space and animation. UI was heavily influenced by analytics and a/b testing. As an extension of Leonardo, the Vizlly brand reflects innovation, ease-of-use and hospitality. The goal was to create a clean and modern brand: software with a human touch. Design elements - minimalism, flat design, hard edges, bold colours, duotones and gradients, neutral space, dynamic images - play heavily with the branding."
