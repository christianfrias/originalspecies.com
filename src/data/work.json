UI was heavily influenced by analytics and a/b testing. As an extension of Leonardo, the Vizlly brand reflects innovation, ease-of-use and hospitality. The goal was to create a clean and modern brand: software with a human touch. Design elements - minimalism, flat design, hard edges, bold colours, duotones and gradients, neutral space, dynamic images - play heavily with the branding."

A few innovations were introduced: Tweets as articles, a rotating articles header, inconspicuous product ads, deeper social media and multimedia integration, themed video playlists, and a real-time trending stories list. Launched “The World of Anne” section, which featured fixture pages that showcased the story, the cast, the music, the books, and various behind the scene experiences. On the backend, a more extensive SEO plan was implemented. All of these were established to present Anne in both a contemporary and sentimental manner."

Various imagery - from florals to scripted handwritten text - were used to evoke the pastoral tranquility of rural Prince Edward Island. Sky blue, field yellow and rose pink were added to complement the original lush green tones. To retain the classic appeal of Anne, various character renditions spanning four films were used in the packaging and designs. Much time was also spent on the original photos from the 80's: from image restoration to enhancement. Greater care was placed on contemporizing these images."
